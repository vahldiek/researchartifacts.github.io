# Research Artifacts Data

This directory contains YAML data files consumed by Jekyll templates.
All files are generated by the [artifact_analysis](https://github.com/researchartifacts/artifact_analysis) pipeline.

## How Data is Generated

```bash
cd ../artifact_analysis
./run_pipeline.sh
```

## Files

| File | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `summary.yml` | Overall statistics and per-area totals |
| `artifacts_by_conference.yml` | Per-conference artifact counts and badge breakdowns |
| `artifacts_by_year.yml` | Yearly trends across all conferences |
| `authors.yml` | Top prolific authors across all areas |
| `author_summary.yml` | Author statistics summary |
| `systems_authors.yml` | Systems area author rankings |
| `security_authors.yml` | Security area author rankings |
| `repo_stats.yml` | GitHub repository metadata (stars, forks, languages) |
| `navigation.yml` | Dropdown navigation menu structure |

Machine-readable JSON exports are available in `../assets/data/`.

## Automated Updates

The GitHub Actions workflow in the `artifact_analysis` repository runs monthly
and commits updated data files back to this repository.
